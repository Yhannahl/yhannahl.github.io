      <description>&amp;ldquo;XUAN&amp;rsquo;QING TEAM 玄青家族&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; An Integreted City IP Design Project. [ The construction of new suburban cities is an important direction in the development of urbanisation in China today. However, the lack of and convergence in the external image of cities has prevented most of the &amp;rsquo;new cities&amp;rsquo; from making an impression on the wider public. XUANQINGTEAM is a set of comprehensive urban IP system design and planning for Qingpu, which is based on the characteristics and advantages of Qingpu development, using design thinking to operate and express, to leave a memory point in the city promotion process, and make the city information be more effectively accessed, thus improving the city&amp;rsquo;s external image and helping the city to further develop. ] &amp;ndash; Video Presentation &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt; · IP Characters Designed</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Ges.edu 基于手势辅助的幼教系统&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Gesture-assisted Early Childhood Education Platform. [ It’s interesting to find that gestures use could help a lot with our daily expression and even the learning process. Besides, with new technology, gestures were developed for more scenarios. Then, I thought about what will be there if gesture could be used into children’s education, which may offer the opportunity for both their learning progress and future adaptability to such interaction modes. ] · Intro · Presentation Interaction Design</description>
