## "FamiPie 派家"
### -- A rapid response housing product for the aftermath of an earthquake.
----------------
[ *FamiPie is a modular air film placement space for PTSD patients after the earthquake. Fami refers to family, representing family; Pie is a description of the appearance of the product.*

*By using a membrane instead of a hard ceiling, PTSD patients are liberated from the worries of "the disaster of extinction", even if it collapses, it will not hurt people at all; by using arc language, subvert the square style of traditional buildings, let The patient enters the unique past environment, quickly escapes from the aftermath of the disaster, and accelerates forgetting the trauma; the two hard plates are like open books, forming a stable triangle. FamiPie expands according to the size of the family to ensure sufficient living space for the individual; realizes regional division through modules and no longer feels "placed"; through the formation of settlements, families can help each other to overcome difficulties together. At the same time, the arc shape makes the arrangement style no longer like a private soldier fighting like a slab house, but rich in layers, with no end in sight at a glance.*]
