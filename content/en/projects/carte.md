## "Carte 卡尔"

----------------
[ *The basics of STEM subjects are widely used in value creation and life. People are paying more and more attention to STEM education, but in the process of interacting with children it becomes clear that there is a great deal of variability in their perception of space which can lead to greater barriers to future learning. Putting aside innate factors, think about whether there can be more organized products that allow young children to better develop spatial thinking while playing.* ]
