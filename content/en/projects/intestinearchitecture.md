## "Intestine Architecture"
### -- VR Datastory of Iceland Turfhouse - Microbial Coliving

---

#### -- Concept

'Intestine Architecture' is a VR narrative where the Turf House superorganism is dormant. When the player enters the house for the first time, it appears quiet and lifeless. However, by exploring the house, the player gradually restores the various uses of its spaces, thereby reawakening the microbial diversity it once harbored. 
</br>
Beings are whispering and portals draw the player into the walls (void), where they can experience the microbes up close on a microscopic scale. With each microbe added back to the turf house's microbiome and the soundscapes' simulations, the overall atmosphere of the house transforms. 
</br>
In the final stage, the turf house becomes unrecognizable, morphing into an organic-looking structure with pulsating, heartbeatlike movements. This new form of the building invites speculation about future architecture inspired from nature: What will future walls look like? Will they derive their structure and stability from organic connections? Will they be flexible and adaptable, or will the focus be on interspecies collaboration?

#### -- Project Key Points

1- Representations of the Invisible: 
The experience invites players to interact with a virtual representation of microbial ecosystems—entities that are integral to life yet invisible to the naked eye.

2- Blurring Boundaries Between the Organic and the Artificial: 
As the Turf House evolves into a pulsating, organic structure, raising critical questions about the merging of biological and artificial systems.

3-Immersion in Constructed Realities: 
By allowing users to explore microbial life on a microscopic scale and witness its transformation, our project illustrates the fluid boundary between what is "real" and what is digitally constructed.

4-Speculation on Future Architectures: 
The reimagined Turf House challenges traditional notions of architecture, proposing a future where interspecies collaboration and organic adaptability replace rigid, static forms, which using art and technology to envision new realities.

5-Interspecies Collaboration and Adaptability: 
By exploring how architecture might evolve to incorporate biological elements, the project critiques the current human-centric paradigm and proposes alternative ways of living—central to the festival's aim to question existing realities.
