## "Roll-up Stool 卷垫凳"
### -- An Upcycling Product.
----------------
[ *The design is a low stool that transforms an idle yoga mat to form a roll-adjustable cushion. The drop between the front and rear rotating shafts of the stool, enables the cushion to adapt to the dynamic process of the human body sitting through forming a certain distance of rolling , while providing more directional support，which makes the interaction with the seat more interesting.* ]
