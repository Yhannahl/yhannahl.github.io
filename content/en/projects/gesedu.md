[ *It’s interesting to find that gestures use could help a lot with our daily expression and even the learning process. Besides, with new technology, gestures were developed for more scenarios.*

*Then, I thought about what will be there if gesture could be used into children’s education, which may offer the opportunity for both their learning progress and future adaptability to such interaction modes.* ]
