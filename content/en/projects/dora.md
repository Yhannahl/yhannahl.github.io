## "Dora Bird Feeder 鸟类喂食器"
### -- An Upcycling Product.
----------------
[ *Dora is a bird feeder made from recycled square packaging gift boxes. The material handling method reduces energy waste as much as possible, and the recycled gift box is assembled with 3D printed accessories that can be used for a long time to continue the use value of the composite paper itself. In terms of styling and decoration, the combination of rattan patterns enhances the decoration, and at the same time increases the possibility of interaction between the bird and the product, thus bringing a richer experience to the observer.*

*The overall purpose of the project is to create a story between humans and natural creatures by enhancing the friendly interaction between humans and natural animals, and to convey the value of sustainable and harmonious development to the society.* ]
