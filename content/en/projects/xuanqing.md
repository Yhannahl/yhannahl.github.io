## "XUAN'QING TEAM 玄青家族"
### -- An Integreted City IP Design Project.
----------------
[ *The construction of new suburban cities is an important direction in the development of urbanisation in China today. However, the lack of and convergence in the external image of cities has prevented most of the 'new cities' from making an impression on the wider public.*

*XUANQINGTEAM is a set of comprehensive urban IP system design and planning for Qingpu, which is based on the characteristics and advantages of Qingpu development, using design thinking to operate and express, to leave a memory point in the city promotion process, and make the city information be more effectively accessed, thus improving the city's external image and helping the city to further develop.* ]
