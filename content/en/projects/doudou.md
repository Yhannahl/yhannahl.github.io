## "DOU'DOU 兜兜淘梦"
### -- An Experimental New Media Project.

----------------

[ *According to the fixed point trajectory, the robotic arm carries out the media projection like a chasing light in the space, connecting multiple fragmented dream segments by the interaction between light & shadow with space.*

*Through constructing the "Escape plan" of "a self-conscious shadow" in our sleep to metaphorize that the past which makes us want to escape is actually a part of our own heart, and we have the ability to face our inner self.* ]
