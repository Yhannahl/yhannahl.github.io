## "AN ORDINARY ROOM 🚪"
### -- A contextualized digital art project about fear aroused by the creature, cockroach, that appeared on a normal day in tropical cities.
----------------
[ *This is an ordinary room. We sit on the couch. We talk. We laugh. We find out something approach. We were scared and we screamed. We finally slap. This is an ordinary normal life.*

*When engaged in ordinary conversation, suddenly, a mysterious and terrifying cockroach scurries into the room. The fear it elicits is universal, transcending cultural boundaries. Our goal is to recreate this experience virtually, triggering memories for those who’ve encountered these resilient creatures and introducing the sensation to those who haven’t.*]

Our project employs projection mapping on furniture, interactive visuals, and videos to simulate a corner of an average room. We invite you to step into this digitalized ordinary 
space, where the unexpected meets the mundane. As you encounter our virtual cockroach, consider your visceral reactions—fear, curiosity, perhaps even respect for its survival instincts.

We would always prompt an immediate desire to distance ourselves from the sight of cockroaches’ glossy, brown carapace scuttling across the floor. The little creature could bring a startling fear with its simple appearance on a normal day. Through digital methods, we will reproduce this scenario and reflect on the behavior patterns of this creature and how people will react to the scenes.
