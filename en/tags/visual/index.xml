[ &amp;lsquo;Blossom to Soar&amp;rsquo; is an interactive installation with generative visuals, exploring the contrast between freedom and bondage, and the creativity of nature.
By picking up the flower pot and then tilting it, grow your digital butterfly orchid and release into the posture of flying butterflies, presenting a magical dance of digital and nature. ]
&amp;ndash; Concept Phalaenopsis, commonly known as butterfly orchids.
The name &amp;lsquo;Phalaenopsis&amp;rsquo; comes from two Greek words, &amp;lsquo;Phalaina&amp;rsquo; (meaning moth or butterfly) and &amp;lsquo;opsis&amp;rsquo; (meaning similar). Therefore, &amp;lsquo;Phalaenopsis&amp;rsquo; translates to &amp;lsquo;plant resembling a butterfly.&amp;rsquo;
Butterfly orchids have been cultivated by humans as ornamental plants with beauty and colorfulness. People give this plant glorious meanings, while the original butterfly orchids that grew in their natural environment were even not noticeable by us.
Indeed, the association between butterfly orchids and butterflies seems to be limited to their outward appearance, without endowing them with true freedom of spirit.</description>
