      <description>&amp;ldquo;ContaminationtoSystem&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; An Embodied interactive mapping with real-time generative visual. [ &amp;lsquo;Contamination to System&amp;rsquo; explores ocean contamination and the threats to sea creatures caused by humans. When people come, trash and pollution liquid leak from their hands and bodies. I do that by using the real-time generated visual to create an embodied interactive mapping.
The project gets inspiration from the phenomenon that some sea creatures consume man-made contamination which then combines in their body and finally flows into the sea ecosystem. ]

&amp;ndash; Concept My experience in underwater diving and sea fishing in shallow sea areas provided me a glimpse into how easily the human-made would become trash and then be ‘forgotten’ in the sea. They are only small parts of the contamination humans have been making to the ocean, not to mention the pollutants that are deliberately released.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;DOUDOU 兜兜淘梦&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; An Experimental New Media Project. [ According to the fixed point trajectory, the robotic arm carries out the media projection like a chasing light in the space, connecting multiple fragmented dream segments by the interaction between light &amp;amp; shadow with space. Through constructing the &amp;ldquo;Escape plan&amp;rdquo; of &amp;ldquo;a self-conscious shadow&amp;rdquo; in our sleep to metaphorize that the past which makes us want to escape is actually a part of our own heart, and we have the ability to face our inner self. ] · Background Story · During the Production &amp;ndash; Video Presentation &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;KUNSI 鲲驷&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; A Digital Interactive Installation. [ Cultural heritage is a constant topic of the times. But as trendy culture sweeps through the social media of young people, is traditional culture being hidden in the torrent of information? We then consider how to awaken people&amp;rsquo;s cultural awareness through the combination of technology and art in the present era, taking the culture of the Han Dynasty, the beginning of Chinese history, as an example. ] · Background · Storyline · Exhibition &amp;ndash; Video Presentation &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;</description>
