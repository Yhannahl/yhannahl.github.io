      <description>&amp;ldquo;AN ORDINARY ROOM ðŸšª&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; A contextualized digital art project about fear aroused by the creature, cockroach, that appeared on a normal day in tropical cities. [ This is an ordinary room. We sit on the couch. We talk. We laugh. We find out something approach. We were scared and we screamed. We finally slap. This is an ordinary normal life.
When engaged in ordinary conversation, suddenly, a mysterious and terrifying cockroach scurries into the room. The fear it elicits is universal, transcending cultural boundaries. Our goal is to recreate this experience virtually, triggering memories for those whoâ€™ve encountered these resilient creatures and introducing the sensation to those who havenâ€™t.]
