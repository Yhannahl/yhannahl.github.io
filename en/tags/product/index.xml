FamiPie expands according to the size of the family to ensure sufficient living space for the individual; realizes regional division through modules and no longer feels &amp;ldquo;placed&amp;rdquo;; through the formation of settlements, families can help each other to overcome difficulties together. At the same time, the arc shape makes the arrangement style no longer like a private soldier fighting like a slab house, but rich in layers, with no end in sight at a glance.&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ &lt;em&gt;Dora is a bird feeder made from recycled square packaging gift boxes. The material handling method reduces energy waste as much as possible, and the recycled gift box is assembled with 3D printed accessories that can be used for a long time to continue the use value of the composite paper itself. In terms of styling and decoration, the combination of rattan patterns enhances the decoration, and at the same time increases the possibility of interaction between the bird and the product, thus bringing a richer experience to the observer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The overall purpose of the project is to create a story between humans and natural creatures by enhancing the friendly interaction between humans and natural animals, and to convey the value of sustainable and harmonious development to the society.&lt;/em&gt; ]&lt;/p&gt;</description>
