      <description>&amp;ldquo;Contamination to System&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; An Embodied interactive mapping with real-time generative visual. [ &amp;lsquo;Contamination to System&amp;rsquo; explores ocean contamination and the threats to sea creatures caused by humans. When people come, trash and pollution liquid leak from their hands and bodies. I do that by using the real-time generated visual to create an embodied interactive mapping.
The project gets inspiration from the phenomenon that some sea creatures consume man-made contamination which then combines in their body and finally flows into the sea ecosystem. ]
&amp;ndash; Video Presentation &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt; Main software: Blender, TouchDesigner, StableDiffusion
Main hardware: Zed Camera
Audio composited using sound effects under CC0 license.
&amp;ndash; Concept My experience in underwater diving and sea fishing in shallow sea areas provided me a glimpse into how easily the human-made would become trash and then be ‚Äòforgotten‚Äô in the sea. They are only small parts of the contamination humans have been making to the ocean, not to mention the pollutants that are deliberately released.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;AN ORDINARY ROOM üö™&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; A contextualized digital art project about fear aroused by the creature, cockroach, that appeared on a normal day in tropical cities. [ This is an ordinary room. We sit on the couch. We talk. We laugh. We find out something approach. We were scared and we screamed. We finally slap. This is an ordinary normal life.
When engaged in ordinary conversation, suddenly, a mysterious and terrifying cockroach scurries into the room. The fear it elicits is universal, transcending cultural boundaries. Our goal is to recreate this experience virtually, triggering memories for those who‚Äôve encountered these resilient creatures and introducing the sensation to those who haven‚Äôt.]

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Blossom to Soar&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; An Interactive installation with physical controller and generative visuals. [ &amp;lsquo;Blossom to Soar&amp;rsquo; is an interactive installation with generative visuals, exploring the contrast between freedom and bondage, and the creativity of nature.
By picking up the flower pot and then tilting it, grow your digital butterfly orchid and release into the posture of flying butterflies, presenting a magical dance of digital and nature. ]
&amp;ndash; Concept Phalaenopsis, commonly known as butterfly orchids.
The name &amp;lsquo;Phalaenopsis&amp;rsquo; comes from two Greek words, &amp;lsquo;Phalaina&amp;rsquo; (meaning moth or butterfly) and &amp;lsquo;opsis&amp;rsquo; (meaning similar). Therefore, &amp;lsquo;Phalaenopsis&amp;rsquo; translates to &amp;lsquo;plant resembling a butterfly.&amp;rsquo;
Butterfly orchids have been cultivated by humans as ornamental plants with beauty and colorfulness. People give this plant glorious meanings, while the original butterfly orchids that grew in their natural environment were even not noticeable by us.
Indeed, the association between butterfly orchids and butterflies seems to be limited to their outward appearance, without endowing them with true freedom of spirit.</description>

[ The construction of new suburban cities is an important direction in the development of urbanisation in China today. However, the lack of and convergence in the external image of cities has prevented most of the &amp;rsquo;new cities&amp;rsquo; from making an impression on the wider public. XUANQINGTEAM is a set of comprehensive urban IP system design and planning for Qingpu, which is based on the characteristics and advantages of Qingpu development, using design thinking to operate and express, to leave a memory point in the city promotion process, and make the city information be more effectively accessed, thus improving the city&amp;rsquo;s external image and helping the city to further develop. ] &amp;ndash; Video Presentation &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt; ¬∑ IP Characters Designed</description>

People are paying more and more attention to STEM education, but in the process of interacting with children it becomes clear that there is a great deal of variability in their perception of space which can lead to greater barriers to future learning. Putting aside innate factors, think about whether there can be more organized products that allow young children to better develop spatial thinking while playing. ] ¬∑ Intro ¬∑ Presentation</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;InterReaction&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; A real-time audio visual experiment. [ InterReaction‚Äôs concept is to create a mesmerizing real-time visual effect to bring sound to life. By combining dynamic particle-based graphics and abstract live camera footage, I create the psychedelic visual experience on screen. Viewers can engage with the visuals by pressing specific keys on the keyboard to switch between different sounds (designated as 1, 2, and 3) and alter graphic patterns (designated as 5, 6, and 7). Additionally, viewers can transform the entire color atmosphere by covering the webcam with their hand or an object.
InterReaction is my initial project using Touchdesigner to explore into the realm of audio-reactive visuals. Through this experiment, I delved into some simple interaction can made to control visual changes, moving materials and audio manipulating methods in the real time interactive multimedia contents. It‚Äôs a great start to seek and create unique sensory storytelling and journey.</description>
