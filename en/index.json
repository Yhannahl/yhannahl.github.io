They are only small parts of the contamination humans have been making to the ocean, not to mention the pollutants that are deliberately released. The project presents the phenomenon in an alerting way. How do simple contaminations become huge burdens? Where will they go? What will they become? Will they come back again to turn on us?\nThe artistic project presents the crisis that sea creatures dying from their original characteristics because of contamination. The conflict between humans and the sea environment is brought into a new perspective that sea creatures are forced to ‘gene variation’ caused by matters from contamination.\nThe work will come as a new theme along with my practice of interactive visuals with physical and embodied interfaces to discuss human and natural life. It aims to bring up fresh visualizations and narrative methods to communicate to the public. It allows people to witness and interact with the process in the exaggerated way. While providing these playful experiences, it offers an ironic and thought-provoking perspective on bio-contamination.\n\u0026ndash; Reflection During the procession of this project, technically I explored more on creating 3D objects as the reactive parts when tracking people\u0026rsquo;s movements. In TouchDesigner, with the Blender-TD add-on by Factory Settings, I could more conveniently import the models and basic materials I made in Blender to TD. Then, I started by exploring points-cloud and different particle systems.
