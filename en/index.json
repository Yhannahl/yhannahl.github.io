The project presents the phenomenon in an alerting way. How do simple contaminations become huge burdens? Where will they go? What will they become? Will they come back again to turn on us?\nThe artistic project presents the crisis that sea creatures dying from their original characteristics because of contamination. The conflict between humans and the sea environment is brought into a new perspective that sea creatures are forced to ‚Äògene variation‚Äô caused by matters from contamination.\nThe work will come as a new theme along with my practice of interactive visuals with physical and embodied interfaces to discuss human and natural life.

In TouchDesigner, with the Blender-TD add-on by Factory Settings, I could more conveniently import the models and basic materials I made in Blender to TD.
