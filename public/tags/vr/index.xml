      <description>&amp;ldquo;Coding Virtual World - VR Projects - New Projects Work in Progress&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Develop VR games/experiences in Unity. 4 - WIP 3 - Nutrient Collector &amp;ndash; Draft &amp;amp; Concept Nutrient Collector - The Living World Underground by Yihan 06102024
I made this little VR game demo for practicing on implementing some basic interactive mechanisms and levels in developing VR world, such as event order, colliders, audio reactions, game restart logic, etc.
Nutrient Collector lets the player collect to save the nutrients that drain away from the living world underground.
WIP: Up to now, I do not have enough time to optimize the models, and I will arrange time to do this iterations later.
Game Logics: You first need to find and open 3 treasure boxes(you can move on the whole platform and teleport to some areas- those small discs), when completed, you will get the tool on the Right hand to &amp;lsquo;collect&amp;rsquo; the &amp;rsquo;nutrition bubbles&amp;rsquo; floating upwards from those giant underground livings.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Carte Âç°Â∞î&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; An Intergrated Product Design Project. [ The basics of STEM subjects are widely used in value creation and life. People are paying more and more attention to STEM education, but in the process of interacting with children it becomes clear that there is a great deal of variability in their perception of space which can lead to greater barriers to future learning. Putting aside innate factors, think about whether there can be more organized products that allow young children to better develop spatial thinking while playing. ] ¬∑ Intro ¬∑ Presentation</description>
