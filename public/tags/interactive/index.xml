      <description>&amp;ldquo;Coding Virtual World - VR Projects - New Projects Work in Progress&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Develop VR games/experiences in Unity. 4 - WIP 3 - Nutrient Collector &amp;ndash; Draft &amp;amp; Concept Nutrient Collector - The Living World Underground by Yihan 06102024
I made this little VR game demo for practicing on implementing some basic interactive mechanisms and levels in developing VR world, such as event order, colliders, audio reactions, game restart logic, etc.
Nutrient Collector lets the player collect to save the nutrients that drain away from the living world underground.
WIP: Up to now, I do not have enough time to optimize the models, and I will arrange time to do this iterations later.
Game Logics: You first need to find and open 3 treasure boxes(you can move on the whole platform and teleport to some areas- those small discs), when completed, you will get the tool on the Right hand to &amp;lsquo;collect&amp;rsquo; the &amp;rsquo;nutrition bubbles&amp;rsquo; floating upwards from those giant underground livings.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Contamination to System&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; An Embodied interactive mapping with real-time generative visual. [ &amp;lsquo;Contamination to System&amp;rsquo; explores ocean contamination and the threats to sea creatures caused by humans. When people come, trash and pollution liquid leak from their hands and bodies. I do that by using the real-time generated visual to create an embodied interactive mapping.
The project gets inspiration from the phenomenon that some sea creatures consume man-made contamination which then combines in their body and finally flows into the sea ecosystem. ]

&amp;ndash; Concept My experience in underwater diving and sea fishing in shallow sea areas provided me a glimpse into how easily the human-made would become trash and then be ‚Äòforgotten‚Äô in the sea. They are only small parts of the contamination humans have been making to the ocean, not to mention the pollutants that are deliberately released.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;AN ORDINARY ROOM üö™&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; A contextualized digital art project about fear aroused by the creature, cockroach, that appeared on a normal day in tropical cities. [ This is an ordinary room. We sit on the couch. We talk. We laugh. We find out something approach. We were scared and we screamed. We finally slap. This is an ordinary normal life.
When engaged in ordinary conversation, suddenly, a mysterious and terrifying cockroach scurries into the room. The fear it elicits is universal, transcending cultural boundaries. Our goal is to recreate this experience virtually, triggering memories for those who‚Äôve encountered these resilient creatures and introducing the sensation to those who haven‚Äôt.]
&amp;ndash; Interaction Design &amp;ndash; Process: Test Video &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;&amp;ndash; Project Reflection Our project employs projection mapping on furniture, interactive visuals, and videos to simulate a corner of an average room.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Blossom to Soar&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; An Interactive installation with physical controller and generative visuals. [ &amp;lsquo;Blossom to Soar&amp;rsquo; is an interactive installation with generative visuals, exploring the contrast between freedom and bondage, and the creativity of nature.
By picking up the flower pot and then tilting it, grow your digital butterfly orchid and release into the posture of flying butterflies, presenting a magical dance of digital and nature. ]
&amp;ndash; Concept Phalaenopsis, commonly known as butterfly orchids.
The name &amp;lsquo;Phalaenopsis&amp;rsquo; comes from two Greek words, &amp;lsquo;Phalaina&amp;rsquo; (meaning moth or butterfly) and &amp;lsquo;opsis&amp;rsquo; (meaning similar). Therefore, &amp;lsquo;Phalaenopsis&amp;rsquo; translates to &amp;lsquo;plant resembling a butterfly.&amp;rsquo;
Butterfly orchids have been cultivated by humans as ornamental plants with beauty and colorfulness. People give this plant glorious meanings, while the original butterfly orchids that grew in their natural environment were even not noticeable by us.
Indeed, the association between butterfly orchids and butterflies seems to be limited to their outward appearance, without endowing them with true freedom of spirit.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;KUN&amp;rsquo;SI È≤≤È©∑&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; A Digital Interactive Installation. [ Cultural heritage is a constant topic of the times. But as trendy culture sweeps through the social media of young people, is traditional culture being hidden in the torrent of information? We then consider how to awaken people&amp;rsquo;s cultural awareness through the combination of technology and art in the present era, taking the culture of the Han Dynasty, the beginning of Chinese history, as an example. ] ¬∑ Background ¬∑ Storyline ¬∑ Exhibition &amp;ndash; Video Presentation &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;</description>
