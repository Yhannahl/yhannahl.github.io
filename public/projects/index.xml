XUANQINGTEAM is a set of comprehensive urban IP system design and planning for Qingpu, which is based on the characteristics and advantages of Qingpu development, using design thinking to operate and express, to leave a memory point in the city promotion process, and make the city information be more effectively accessed, thus improving the city&amp;#39;s external image and helping the city to further develop.</description>
